# Support Agent Project Plan

## Project Overview
A support agent system that can:
- Have chat conversations with users
- Look up relevant documentation and information
- Access product information via serial numbers
- Access customer information via serial numbers
- Store and retrieve user interaction history
- Identify and store potential solutions for future reference

## Architecture
1. **Frontend**
   - Chat interface for user interaction
   - Admin interface for managing documents and solutions

2. **Backend**
   - API layer for handling requests
   - Integration with OpenAI for natural language processing
   - Supabase integration for data storage and vector search
   - Document processing and indexing system

3. **Data Storage**
   - Vector database for document embeddings (Supabase)
   - Customer information database
   - Product information database
   - Conversation history storage
   - Known issues and solutions repository

## Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**
   - Set up project structure with Pydantic AI
   - Configure logging with Pydantic Logfire
   - Create database schemas in Supabase
   - Implement document processing pipeline

2. **Phase 2: Support Agent Core**
   - Implement chat functionality with OpenAI integration
   - Develop document search and retrieval system
   - Create product/customer lookup tools
   - Build basic conversation history tracking

3. **Phase 3: Enhanced Features**
   - Implement user history and preferences system
   - Develop solution suggestion and storage mechanisms
   - Add document indexing and updating capabilities
   - Create admin tools for managing knowledge base

4. **Phase 4: Optimization and Expansion**
   - Implement document Q&A pair generation for fine-tuning
   - Fine-tune models with domain-specific data
   - Optimize vector search for better performance
   - Add analytics and reporting features

## Evaluation Metrics
