# Project-Wiki
We are creating very detailed documentation in the Project-Wiki directory.
[index.md](mdc:Project-Wiki/index.md) is the main file and all other files should link to this. 

When asked review the index file then create the requested wiki page and link it.
If needed review other pages and make neccesary edits.

If needed review [Plan.md](mdc:docs/Plan.md), [Tasks.md](mdc:docs/Tasks.md), [stack.md](mdc:docs/stack.md) for more information about our project.
