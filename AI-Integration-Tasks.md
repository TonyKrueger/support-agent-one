# AI Model Integration Tasks

## Overview
This document outlines the specific tasks for integrating the OpenAI model with our chat interface to provide AI-generated responses to user queries.

## High-Priority Tasks

### 1. Connect OpenAI Service with Conversation Manager
- [x] Modify `app/web/chat.py` to use the OpenAI service for responses
- [x] Replace placeholder responses with actual AI-generated responses
- [x] Add configuration for controlling AI parameters (temperature, max_tokens)
- [x] Implement streaming response handling in WebSocket endpoint

### 2. Enhance Context Building
- [ ] Improve system prompt to include product and customer context
- [x] Update context retrieval to include more relevant document chunks
- [x] Implement context window management to prevent token limit issues
- [ ] Add support for maintaining conversation context across sessions

### 3. Implement Error Handling and Fallbacks
- [x] Add proper error handling for API limits and timeouts
- [x] Create fallback responses for when the AI service is unavailable
- [x] Implement rate limiting to prevent excessive API usage
- [ ] Add logging for AI request/response cycles

### 4. Response Processing
- [x] Implement content moderation using OpenAI's moderation API
- [ ] Add structured response parsing for special actions
- [ ] Process and format AI responses for display in the UI
- [ ] Implement response caching for frequently asked questions

## Medium-Priority Tasks

### 5. Performance Optimization
- [x] Implement response streaming for better user experience
- [ ] Add caching layer for common queries
- [ ] Optimize token usage by refining context selection
- [ ] Implement background processing for document retrieval

### 6. Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Create unit tests for AI integration
- [ ] Implement integration tests for the complete conversation flow
- [ ] Create a mock OpenAI service for testing
- [ ] Set up automated testing for response quality

### 7. Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation with AI integration details
- [ ] Create developer guide for AI response customization
- [ ] Document prompt engineering techniques and best practices
- [ ] Create user guide for interacting with the AI assistant

## Low-Priority Tasks

### 8. Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement multi-step reasoning for complex queries
- [ ] Add support for generating images or diagrams when needed
- [ ] Create feedback mechanism for improving AI responses
- [ ] Develop personalization based on user interaction history

### 9. Monitoring and Analytics
- [ ] Set up monitoring for AI response quality
- [ ] Create analytics dashboard for AI usage metrics
- [ ] Implement feedback collection for responses
- [ ] Set up alerting for API usage and rate limits
